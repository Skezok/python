# python
Here is my python repo

[Scanner_GUI.py]
  It will be a Nmap scanner but with a GUI like Zenmap on Windows.
  I am using Tkinter librarie from Python to perform the GUI.
  I have already the GUI and the CLI Scanner, all I have to do now is to match the things.


[Scanner.py]
  It is just a Nmap CLI Scanner like the original one but you doesn't need to call the script with arguments.
  All you need to do is to run the script and then enter the IPÂ you want to scan and th etype of scan you want.
  

[HomeDos.py]
  It is just a simple tools in Python to DOS a Google Home.
  You just need to request the Google Home with the parameters "reboot" every 60 seconds and the Google Home will be unreachable at vitam eternam.
  The only things you need is the IP address but with a Nmap scan you can easily recover that information.
